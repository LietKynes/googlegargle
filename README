Some quick patches to the script from http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Google_Video

This version runs googlegargle in parallel for situations like mine where I'm throttled at 80k per download, but I can have several in parallel. I don't know if google or my ISP does the throttling.

By default the script behaves like the previous versions:
fetch id from the server
launch googlegargle for that id
when googlegargle finishes fetching another id and so on
'touch STOP' to stop the script abruptly

Extra features:
download stuff in parallel
on-the-fly selection of the number of parallel jobs (echo 1 or 10 or 150 > _max_concurrent from another terminal)
graceful exit (echo 0 > _max_concurrent)
resume still-running downloads after an abrupt exit
use a cherrypick list of IDs first, then get IDs from the server when it's back up again
_list file format: plaintext, one id per line
